# HorizontalReading
A collection of one click scripts (bookmarklets) to make reading experiene 10x better

**Asura** - [Copy from here and paste to Add Bookmark -> URL](asura_horizontal_bookmark.js)

# Guide
Put the code in a bookmark , load site, click bookmark (it runs the script) 
click twice to mark the horizontal panel, it rotates , success 
If you want use the undo buttons
Also did rotation direction

## Functionality
- change rotate direction
- undo (in case you mess up)
- you gotta click on each refresh or next chapter (for now)


# To Do 
 - examples
 - different websites ( Asura, MangaKatana ) 
 - zoom for super long panels
 - Make it persistent accross chapters

## Future ideas
 - shareable chapter positioning
 - loading someones already rotated images, just click and read
 - share your own layouts and positioning (rotations)

 - https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/   (just paste js code, generate and drag to bookmarks bar)

The raw bookmarks look like that because they are URL-encode to be usable as a bookmarklet. You can test it yourself by copying the code from asuracomic_horizontal_v3.js and put in encodeURIComponent
