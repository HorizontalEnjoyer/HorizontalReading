# HorizontalReading
A collection of one click scripts (bookmarklets) to make reading experiene 10x better

**Asura** - [Copy from here and paste to Add Browser Bookmark -> URL](asura_horizontal_bookmark.js)
**MangaKatana**  - [Copy from here and paste in URL field of Add Browser Bookmark] (mangakatana_horizontal_bookmark.js)

# Guide
 1. Copy the Code (from "website_of_choice"_bookmark.js) in a **Browser Bookmark** (Right click toolbar, Add, Paste to URL)
 2. **Load manhwa chapter** on site of choice 
 3. Click **bookmark** (it runs the script) 
 4. Click twice (start and end of images) to mark the horizontal panel
 5. It Rotates
 6. Success

if something breaks, refresh page and run again
if you cant make it work come to discord I will help (see end of read me )

If you want use the undo buttons
Also did rotation direction

## Functionality
- change rotate direction
- undo (in case you mess up)
- you gotta start script on each refresh or next chapter (for now)


# To Do 
 - examples
 - different websites ( apart from Asura, MangaKatana ) 
 - zoom for super long panels
 - Make it persistent accross chapters

## Future ideas
 - shareable chapter positioning
 - loading someones already rotated images, just click and read
 - share your own layouts and positioning (rotations) 


# Extra

Join Discord if you want - https://discord.gg/FdN9NsSZ 
 will upload some examples there how to work
 as well as some plans for future development

### More info
 - https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/c0cec1f89ccdb8b469b1    ( read up on bookmarklets ) 
 - https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/   (just paste js code, generate and drag to bookmarks bar)

The raw bookmarks look like that because they are URL-encode to be usable as a bookmarklet. You can test it yourself by copying the code from asuracomic_horizontal_v3.js and put in encodeURIComponent
